## D1 — Prices are integer ticks
**Decision.** All prices inside the book are integers (number of ticks). Conversion to currency happens outside.
**Why.** Avoids floating-point comparisons in the matching logic; makes equality of price levels exact.
**Consequence.** The simulator and the candidate-order generator must produce tick prices; metrics convert back.

## D2 — Mid price is the only non-integer quantity in the book
**Decision.** `mid()` returns a float (`best_bid + spread / 2`), e.g. 101.5 for bid 100 / ask 103. All other prices stay integer ticks (D1).
**Why.** The mid is a reference level, not a tradeable price: nothing is ever placed or filled at it. Forcing it to an integer would bias every cost measured against it by up to half a tick.
**Consequence.** Costs expressed "relative to mid" (the paper's `c_t`) are floats in tick units. Any code that needs a price to *send* an order (candidate generation, mid-IOC) must round explicitly and record the rounding rule.

## D3 — Book invariants are enforced by construction in the matching logic and verified by check_invariants() in randomized tests, never checked at runtime in hot paths.

## D4 - In the function `cancel` the line `queue.remove(order)` takes O(n). Might need later optimimization in case of long queues.
